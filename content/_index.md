#  Hi I'm Cole BorenðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my personal corner of the internetâ€” just digital bag of holding where I stash my journey, current adventures, and future quests in the world of code.

I've been honing my programming skills for about five years as of 9/10/24.
Here expect to find insights and discussions on Go, unit testing, quality assurance, performance optimization, minimalisim, and keeping things simple.
