#  Hi I'm Cole BorenðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my personal corner of the internetâ€” just digital bag of holding where I stash my journey, current adventures, and future quests in the world of code.

I've been honing my programming skills since late 2019.
Here expect to find insights and discussions on Go, unit testing, quality assurance, performance optimization, minimalisim, and keeping things simple.
